## Key Features

Polynotes key features include **interactive auto-complete**, **error highlighting**, **rich text editing** and **LaTeX equations**. Currently only the [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming languages are supported. Polynote also includes [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) support from both Python and Scala, see the [Polynote Docs](https://polynote.org/docs/02-basic-usage.html#using-spark-with-polynote) for more information.
